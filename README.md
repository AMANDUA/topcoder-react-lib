# Topcoder React Lib

### Development

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run test & build
npm test
npm run build

# Go to other project which depends on the topcoder-react-lib, config its package.json so 
# that the 'topcoder-react-lib' points to the local foler path of topcoder-react-lib:
#
# "dependencies": {
#   "topcoder-react-lib": "<local-path-to-topcoder-react-lib>",
#   ......
# }
#
